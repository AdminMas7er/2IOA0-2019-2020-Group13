## FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK ON PYTHON STUFF AND  DOWNLOAD THE FILES 

** You _need_ to do these steps first:**
1. Make sure you have the **latest** version of Python installed (3.8), if you don't you can
download it from [here] (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/python-3.8.1-amd64.exe)

2. Put all the files in a folder

**ALWAYS DO THESE STEPS EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO RUN THE APP WHEN YOU OPEN THE COMMAND LINE FOR THE FIRST TIME**

3. in the command line, put the following code (here it depends per laptop but I assume you use the TUe one):
```cd C:\Users\Your "2018-" or "2019-" number here\Desktop\File Name ```

4. Create a virtual enviroment (in command line):
```py -3 -m venv venv```

5. Activate the enviroment:
``` venv\Scrips\activate```

**MANDATORY STEPS END HERE**

6. Install Flask:
```pip install Flask ```

7. Use this everytime you want to run the app (**ANOTHER MANDATORY STEP**):
```flask run```

Then, when you do that, you will probably see an IP address of the form```http://ip/```
Just copy that in a browser to see how the website runs
